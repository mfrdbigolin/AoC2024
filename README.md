# *AoC2024*: Advent of Code 2024 Rust Solutions

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) (also known
as *AoC2024*) with Rust (again!) in the twilight of this year.

When working on my solutions, I strive to make them as general as possible, that
is, they could be adapted to solve similar problems.  Elegance, readability, and
efficiency,  in  this  order,  are  also my  concerns,  though  secondary  after
generality.

## Usage

The general usage of `advent`, for a particular *DAY*, is

* `cargo run` *`DAY`*

Additionally,  if you  have another  input for  a particular  day stored  in the
`inputs`â€™  folder, name  it  in the  format `day`*`DAY`*`.`*`EXT`*`.txt`,  where
*EXT* is  any arbitrary extension.  To use  it, append *EXT*  to the end  of the
command, like this:

* `cargo run` *`DAY`* *`EXT`*
